Task 1:
	Complete the getEventsWithWorkshops function that returns all events with workshops (Warmup)
	Requirements:

	maximum 2 sql queries

Sample response on GET /events:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Laravel convention 2020",
            "created_at": "2021-04-25T09:32:27.000000Z",
            "updated_at": "2021-04-25T09:32:27.000000Z",
            "workshops": [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "start": "2020-02-21 10:00:00",
                    "end": "2020-02-21 16:00:00",
                    "event_id": 1,
                    "name": "Illuminate your knowledge of the laravel code base",
                    "created_at": "2021-04-25T09:32:27.000000Z",
                    "updated_at": "2021-04-25T09:32:27.000000Z"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Laravel convention 2021",
            "created_at": "2021-04-25T09:32:27.000000Z",
            "updated_at": "2021-04-25T09:32:27.000000Z",
            "workshops": [
               ...
               ...
            ]
         }
     ]
     ```

Task 2:

    Requirements:
    - only events that have not yet started should be included
    - the event starting time is determined by the first workshop of the event
    - the eloquent expressions should result in maximum 3 SQL queries, no matter the amount of events
    - all filtering of records should happen in the database
    - verify your solution with `php artisan test`
    - do a `git commit && git push` after you are done or when the time limit is over

    Hints:
    - open the `app/Http/Controllers/EventsController` file
    - partial or not working answers also get graded so make sure you commit what you have
    - join, whereIn, min, groupBy, havingRaw might be helpful
    - in the sample data set  the event with id 1 is already in the past and should therefore be excluded

    Sample response on GET /futureevents:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Laravel convention 2021",
            "created_at": "2021-04-20T07:01:14.000000Z",
            "updated_at": "2021-04-20T07:01:14.000000Z",
            "workshops": [
                {
                    "id": 2,
                    "start": "2021-10-21 10:00:00",
                    "end": "2021-10-21 18:00:00",
                    "event_id": 2,
                    "name": "The new Eloquent - load more with less",
                    "created_at": "2021-04-20T07:01:14.000000Z",
                    "updated_at": "2021-04-20T07:01:14.000000Z"
                },
                {
                    "id": 3,
                    "start": "2021-11-21 09:00:00",
                    "end": "2021-11-21 17:00:00",
                    "event_id": 2,
                    "name": "AutoEx - handles exceptions 100% automatic",
                    "created_at": "2021-04-20T07:01:14.000000Z",
                    "updated_at": "2021-04-20T07:01:14.000000Z"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "React convention 2021",
            "created_at": "2021-04-20T07:01:14.000000Z",
            "updated_at": "2021-04-20T07:01:14.000000Z",
            "workshops": [
                {
                   ...
                   ...
                }
             ]
         }
         ...
         ...

Task 3:
    Requirements:
    - the eloquent expressions should result in EXACTLY one SQL query no matter the nesting level or the amount of menu items.
    - it should work for infinite level of depth (children of childrens children of childrens children, ...)
    - verify your solution with `php artisan test`
    - do a `git commit && git push` after you are done or when the time limit is over

    Hints:
    - open the `app/Http/Controllers/MenuController` file
    - eager loading cannot load deeply nested relationships
    - a recursive function in php is needed to structure the query results
    - partial or not working answers also get graded so make sure you commit what you have

    Sample response on GET /menu:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "All events",
            "url": "/events",
            "parent_id": null,
            "created_at": "2021-04-27T15:35:15.000000Z",
            "updated_at": "2021-04-27T15:35:15.000000Z",
            "children": [
                {
                    "id": 2,
                    "name": "Laracon",
                    "url": "/events/laracon",
                    "parent_id": 1,
                    "created_at": "2021-04-27T15:35:15.000000Z",
                    "updated_at": "2021-04-27T15:35:15.000000Z",
                    "children": [
                        {
                           ...
                           ...
                        }
                     ]
                 }
                 ...
                 ...
         }
    ]
